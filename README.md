# odin-landing-page
This is a landing page created to help me learn flex-box and css.

The goal of this project is to have fun, learn some stuff, and reinforce what this entire chapter
of the curriculum has been teaching me. I will be basing this webpage off two png's TheOdinProject
provided as per the project's guidelines. The png's in question can be found in the guidelines
directory.
